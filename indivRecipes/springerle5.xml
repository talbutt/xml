    <description><xhtml:p>This recipe is said to have been brought to this country about 125 years ago by my husband's great-great grandparents. We don't know how long before that it was in the family. My husbands's mother, a home economics teacher, updated the recipe for the modern kitchen (ie, with gas &amp; electricity) These are absolute got to have at christmas for my husband and his brother.</xhtml:p>

<xhtml:p>As children my husband and his brother had to help with the beating. (at least one hour by hand). They both claim it was the only thing their grandmother made well!</xhtml:p>

<xhtml:p>When these cookies bake, the smell of ammonia can be quite strong, especially when you open the oven door. I recommend turning your head away as you open the door, unless, like me, you like the smell.</xhtml:p></description>

    <directions>
      <step>Beat eggs until light. Gradually add sugar. Beat for 30 minutes. (If you have a powerful stand mixer, 15 to 20 minutes is sufficient.)</step>
      <step>Add ammonium carbonate and water. Beat to distribute evenly.</step>
      <step>Gradually add flour. (unless you have a large capacity stand mixer, some will have to be beaten in by hand). Dough should be very stiff and of rolling consistency. Add more flour if necessary.</step>
      <step>Let dough rest in bowl, covered with a damp cloth while you generously butter 8 large cookie sheets. Sprinkle anise seeds over the butter.</step>
      <step>Roll out dough about 3/8-inch thick on a floured board. Cut out circles (about 2" in diameter) or squares and place widely spaced on cookie sheets. Press designs on tops with cookie stamp. (we use a gear from a meat grinder - it's tradition!). Press just hard enough to imprint but not spread out the cookie.</step>
      <step>Cover cookie sheets with linen dish cloths or a clean sheet and let rest overnight or at least 8 hours.</step>
      <step>Bake cookies at <temp><qty>350</qty><tempunit unit="F" system="US">degrees</tempunit><!--350  degrees--></temp> for 8-9 minutes, reduce heat to <temp><qty>275</qty><tempunit unit="F" system="US">degrees</tempunit><!--275  degrees--></temp> and bake an additional 8-9 minutes. Cookies will rise and ooze out the side, but the top should remain intact. If done right, there will be a hollow area under the design.</step>
