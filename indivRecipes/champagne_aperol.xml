    <description><x:p>This was the drink of choice for my cousin's 30th
    birthday party. As guests arrived, each was handed a cocktail. My cousin,
    aunt and I spent the rest of my visit drinking a champagne bottle's worth
    of these each night while we hashed over family gossip. (Only two glasses
    each.) By the time I left, the bottle Aperol bitters was finished.</x:p>

    <x:p>I'd never heard of Aperol before; it's a bitter like Campari. "Aperol
    is Pepsi; Campari is Coke," explained one birthday reveler. The analogy
    was more true than he realized; like Pepsi, Aperol is a bit sweeter than
    its competition.</x:p></description>
